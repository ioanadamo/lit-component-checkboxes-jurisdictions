# Select jurisdiction circuits

The project is made using a lit component starter project and it contains a lit component called select-jurisdiction-circuits which contains two forms with checkboxes that allow the user to select the jurisdictions or circuits; when a circuit is selected, all the jurisdictions belonging to that circuit will be selected.

The structure, it's more similar to a widget but it can be modified to be more generalist, and allow more props.

It also allows the user to set by props, a pre-selected list of jurisdictions.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Dev Server

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```
